# Fashion MNIST Classification

**Fashion-MNIST** is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, for a total of 784 pixels in total, associated with a label from 10 classes. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels, and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist. Please go to the website for a complete description of the dataset.

Some of the codes and notes in this notebook is taken from ***Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurelien Geron***.
